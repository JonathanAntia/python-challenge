Analyze two large datasets, pyBank and pyPoll, using python scripts

PyBank:

    In this challenge, the task is to create a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a company. 
    The financial dataset to analyze is called budget_data.csv.
    The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses.

    The Python script must analyze the records to calculate each of the following:
        1. The total number of months included in the dataset
        2. The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
        3. The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
        4. The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
        5. The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

    In addition, the final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.


PyPoll: 

    In this challenge, the task is to help a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process.
    It will be accomplished by creating a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

        1. The total number of votes cast
        2. A complete list of candidates who received votes
        3. The percentage of votes each candidate won
        4. The total number of votes each candidate won
        5. The winner of the election based on popular vote.

    In addition, the final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

    The poll data to analyze is included in the file: election_data.csv. 
    The dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate.
